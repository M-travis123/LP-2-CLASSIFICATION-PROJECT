# VODAFONE CLASSIFICATION AND PREDICTING CUSTOMER CHURN PROJECT
In this project, we aim to find the likelihood of a customer leaving the organization, the key indicators of churn as well as the retention strategies that can be implemented to avert this problem.


### Prerequisites
Before diving into the project, make sure you have:

Knowledge of Python
Familiarity with utility libraries like Pandas, Numpy
Basic understanding of visualization libraries like Seaborn, Matplotlib
Implementable knowledge of SciKit Learn
Understanding of concepts such as Data Transformation, Feature Engineering, Model Training, Model Evaluation, and Model Testing

### Libraries:

Ensure you have Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SciKit Learn installed.

### Building Process

Load the necessary datasets and libraries required for the project.
Analysis:

Understand the structure of the data, including columns, values, and data types.
Visualization:

Use Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize the dataset and grasp underlying patterns.
Data Cleaning:

Fill in missing values and clean the dataset.
Feature Engineering:

Understand features and create new ones based on essential insights.
Model Training:

Utilize algorithms like logistic regression, random forest to train the model.
Evaluation:

Assess the predictive model's performance.
### Testing:

Test the model and compute accuracy.
